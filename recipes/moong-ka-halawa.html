    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p> The Turkish confection of ground sesame seeds and honey is believed to have travelled towards the eastern
        countries in medieval times and became our very own Halwa as we see today. Moong dal ka Halwa is a special
        dessert, with its origins tracing back to Rajasthan, mostly prepared in winters as a warm dessert. Rajasthan and
        its ingenious use of making the most with its liminal resources due to its geographical alignments, possibly
        makes for one of the most interesting facets of Indian cooking. Moong dal ka halwa is also considered to be one
        of the most auspicious desserts in the region and is prepared widely for special occasions such as Diwali or any
        religious occasions and weddings.

        <li>Grind soaked dal in a mixer to a make coarse paste. If needed, you can add very little (about 2 tablespoons)
            water, but don’t too much water while grinding dal, as it will take more time in sautéing.</li>
