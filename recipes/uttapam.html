    <h2>Description :</h2>
    <p>An uttapam (or uthapam, uttappam, etc.) is a type of dosa from South India. Unlike a typical dosa, which is crisp
        and crepe-like, an uttapam is thicker, with toppings. The name is derived from the Tamil words appam and utthia
        or uttria, meaning "poured appam", because appam is cooked in a round-bottom pan, whereas utthia-appam is cooked
        on a flat skillet. Tamil ancient literature mentions it by name. The classic breakfast of Tamil residents
        consists of idli, dosas or uttappams mostly accompanied by sambar and chutney.
