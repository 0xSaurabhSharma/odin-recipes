        <li>1/2 cup almonds</li>
        <li>2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon corn flour</li>
        <li>4 green cardamom</li>
        <li>3 teaspoon rose water</li>

    </ul>
    <h2>Steps :</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Soaking Moong dal:</strong></li>
        <p>To prepare this recipe, start by chopping the almonds on a clean chopping board. Then, take the cardamoms and
            crush them a bit. Keep aside for later use. Now, in a blender, pour 1/2 cup sugar along with 1/4 cup almonds
            and blend it well. Now, take another pan over medium flame and heat 2 litres of milk and bring it to a boil.
            Add lemon juice and once the milk starts thickening, drain the milk using a cloth and wash it under running
            water to get rid of the lemon juice. Your cottage cheese (chenna) is ready.</p>
        <li><strong>Make the Milk Rabdi</strong></li>
        <p>Heat another deep pan over medium flame, add the rest of the milk, and keep stirring. Next, add saffron and
            boil till the milk is reduced to half. Now, add in the sugar and almond mixture along with the crushed
            cardamom, keep stirring and then add in the rose water. Make sure the milk rabri isn't too runny or too
            thick. Transfer this mixture to a bowl and keep aside.</p>
        <li><strong>Knead Small Chenna Balls</strong></li>
        <p>Now, take the hanging cheesecloth and open it. The milk inside should have formed a chenna by now. Pour the
            chenna into a large bowl and add the cornflour and baking soda to it. Knead it a little and then, make small
            balls with it and press them a little with your hands.</p>
        <li><strong>Cook the Chenna Balls</strong></li>
        <p>Next, take a vessel over medium flame and pour water in 2 and 1/2 cups of water along with 1 and 1/2 cup of
            sugar, keep stirring. Once the sugar syrup starts boiling reduce the flame and gradually add the chenna
            balls, cover with a lid and allow the chenna balls to fluff up.</p>
        <li><strong>Garnish and Relish!</strong></li>
        <p>Once the chenna balls are fluffed up, turn off the flame and dip these balls in the milk rabri and allow the
            little balls to soak up the goodness and sweetness of sweetened milk. Garnish with some almonds, saffron
            strands and a dash of cardamom. When the Angoori Rasmalai is done, refrigerate for an hour and serve
            chilled!</p>
        <strong>Tips: </strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Make sure you keep stirring the milk else it will stick to the bottom and spoil the taste of the rabri.
            </li>
            <li>You can add in some saffron strands and whole cardamoms to the sugar syrup accentuate the taste of the
                rasmalai balls.</li>
            <li>To make the dough soft, make sure you knead the chenna nicely.</li>
            <li>To make the rasmalai rich in taste, you can also add in some condenesed milk to the rabri.</li>
        </ul>
